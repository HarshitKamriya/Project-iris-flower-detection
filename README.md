# ğŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project is based on the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of different flower species such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

A machine learning model was trained to classify flowers into species, and the model has been deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively predict the flower type by adjusting the input features.
